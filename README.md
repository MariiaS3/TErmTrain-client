# Getting Started with Create React App
<h1 >TermTrain</h1>  
TermTrain is a web application designed and written for my BA thesis. Now I want to develop this and deploy it on Heroku.
The frontend for this api is on repository TermTrain.

<h1>General info</h1>
The main goal of the work was to create a didactic application imitating the behavior of the command line. This app will help new users learn how to use Linux terminal commands.

<h2>TODO's:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    A web application that allows you to use the bash terminal in a web browser without having to install Linux or control it on a virtual machine.
  </li>
  <li>
  The web application allows you to learn bash terminal commands through hands-on exercises.
  </li>
  <li>
   Aplikacja zawiera podstawowe polecenia terminala systemu Linux, takie jak: ls, cd, cp, mv, cat, rm, mkdir, rmdir, touch, nano, man. 
  </li>
  <li>
   Users will be able to consolidate their knowledge by taking a quiz.
    </li>
      <li>
  Before starting the quiz, the user will be able to read this short description of the commands.
      </li>
  <li>
While taking the quiz, users will be able to test their own
answer by typing the appropriate commands in the terminal.
  </li>
  <li>
An additional functionality of the application will be the possibility for users to leave questions related to the Linux system or the bash terminal. Users will
they could also leave their comments under selected questions.
  </li>
</ul>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
